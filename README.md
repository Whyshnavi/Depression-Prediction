# Depression-Prediction
# Overview

This project aims to predict depression using a machine learning model trained on a depression prediction dataset. The dataset includes features relevant to mental health indicators, and the model leverages these features to identify potential cases of depression. This repository contains the code, dataset (or links to it), and documentation for reproducibility and further development.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features related to depression indicators (e.g., survey responses, demographic data, or behavioral metrics).
